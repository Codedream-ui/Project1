          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;loat:left;">Abstract: </span>Water shortage can be caused by population growth that drives the growth of water demand for domestic, agricultural and industrial purposes. Water shortage in water-rich areas can be also caused by water pollution. The water problem caused by poor quality and insufficient quantity has been widely noted and well informed among the researchers, decision makers and ordinary people, but not much research considers these facts: 1) more and more people migrate to the coastal areas; 2) sedimentation by soil erosion reduces the storage capacity of existing reservoirs 1% annually, or almost all existing reservoirs will be silt in the following 50-100 years; 3) for developed countries, it is almost impossible to build new dams to replace the lost storage, thus a big question to ask is where the people to find their drinking water in future. The answer provided in this keynote speech is that in future almost everyone will drink the water from coastal reservoirs- freshwater reservoirs inside seawater. We will review the development of coastal reservoir, its difference with the inland reservoirs and highlights why coastal reservoirs will dominate tomorrow’s water supply. Its possible application for Beijing’s water crisis will be discussed after the completion of China’s South-North Water Diversion project.
